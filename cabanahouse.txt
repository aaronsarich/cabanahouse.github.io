Hey, I'm Aaron and this website is just me showing off all my shit so I can feel special.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>Please understand that this is a work in progress, anything is subject to change/update.</p>
<p>Most of the content consists of shit I have made and yes, it's completely original. Who would have fucking thought?</p> <!-- bitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlagbitlag -->
<p>It upsets me that people throw away their dreams, only because of lack of motivation, work, school and how inappropriately conceited <a href="https://i.ibb.co/GprMSY0/1582424160189.gif">"smart"</a> people are. I plan on atleast trying to help people accomplish what they want for themselves, their goals, and their extremely unreachable dreams.</p><!-- delaydelaydelaydelaydelaydelaydelay -->
<p>Most of the content on this page will be completely new, not released anywhere else, but the rest would be on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC083Vd3pwc7HMye3GWoZcSw?">youtube</a>; <br><br><br>Or (what I hope) to be using more regularly now <a href="cabanahouserecords.bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a>.</p><!-- moredelaymoredelaymoredelaymoredelaymoredelaymoredelay-->

If you want to place an order, ask a question, show me your project<!-- slightdelayhere-->, you can send me an email <!-- longlonglongcomment --><a href="cabanahouserecords@gmail.com">here</a>!<br>
